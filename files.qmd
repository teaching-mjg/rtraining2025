# File Handling

## Read multiple files

You have a folder containing multiple results files, one for each participant, and you want a single results file, with every participant in it, one under the other.

* loop over a directory's files
  * read each file
    * `read_csv()`; `read_excel()`
  * edit each file
    * `mutate()`
    * `rename()`
    * `relocate()`
    * `relocate()` with internal `rename()`
    * `select()`
  * add each edited file to an overall dataset
    * `bind_rows()`
* export the overall dataset
  * `write_csv()`; `write_excel_csv()`
